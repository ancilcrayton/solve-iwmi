DSSG Solve
----------------------------

Solve for Good is a platform for social good organizations to describe and submit problems that need
data intensive help, and for volunteers to help solve those problems. Once the projects are
submitted by the organization, they go through a scoping process (done by scoping volunteers and
guided by our Data Science Scoping Process). Once a project scope is finalized and reviewed, it
becomes available for data science volunteers to start working on. The finished work is reviewed by
a QA team consisting of volunteers and staff of the organization that submitted the project and
given back to the organization as well as shared publicly on github.
